# Smoothing Line Segments

At one point, someone in the [cocoa-dev mailing list](https://lists.apple.com/mailman/listinfo/cocoa-dev) asked for an algorithm to draw a smooth curve passing through a number of given points. I solved the problem mathematically, then wrote a small application implementing the algorithm. The algorithm involves interpolating the points using [_Bezier curves_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BÃ©zier_curve).
